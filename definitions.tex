\subsection{Definitions and Preliminaries} % (fold)
\label{sec:definitions}
In this section, we establish additional definitions for our paper. These
are mostly of interest for our spanner results, and are not strictly
necessary for Theorem~\ref{thm:NN}.

\noindent \textbf{Spanners:} For real value $t \geq 1$, a $t$-spanner of
a weighted graph $G$ is a subgraph $S$ such that $d_G(x,y) \leq d_S(x,y)
\leq t\cdot d_G(x,y)$ where $d_G$ and $d_S$ represent the shortest path
distance functions between vertex pairs in $G$ and $S$. Spanners
of Euclidean distances, and general graph distances, have been
studied extensively, and their importance as a data structure is
well established.

\noindent \textbf{$k$-nearest neighbor graphs:} The $k$-nearest neighbor graph
($k$-NN graph) for a set of objects $V$ is a graph with vertex set $V$
and an edge from $v\in V$ to its $k$ most similar objects in $V$, under
a given distance measure. In this paper, the underlying distance
measure is Euclidean, and the edge weights are Euclidean distance
squared.
$k$-NN
graph constructions are a key data structure in machine
learning~\cite{Dong11, Chen11}, clustering~\cite{vL09}, and manifold learning~\cite{tenenbaum00global}.

\noindent \textbf{Gabriel Graphs:} The Gabriel graph is a graph where
two vertices $p$ and $q$ are joined by an edge if and only if the disk
with diameter $pq$ has no other points of $S$ in the interior. The
Gabriel graph is a subgraph of the Delaunay
triangulation~\cite{SridharMaster}, and a
$1$-spanner of the edge-squared metric~\cite{SridharMaster}. Gabriel
graphs will be used in the proof of
Theorem~\ref{thm:distribution-spanner}.
