\subsection{Construction of $G'$}

Let $x_0, x_1, \ldots x_{n-1}$ be our point set.
Let $G'$ be a graph on $\mathbb{R}^{2^n}$, with vertices $v_{S}$ for all $S
\subset \{0,1,\ldots n-1\}$. Here, $v_{\{i\}}$ corresponds to $x_i$. Connect vertices $v_S$ and $v_T$ for $S, T \subset
\{0, 1, \ldots n-1\}$ iff sets $S$ and $T$ differ by exactly one element. We
assign this edge a cost of $|R_{S}^q - R_{T}^q|$, where $R_{S}$ is the
circumradius of points $\{x_s : s \in S\}$.

It is not difficult to see that the distance to travel from $v_{\{i\}}$ to $v_{\{i,
j\}}$ to $v_{\{j\}}$ is the $q$-edge poewr distance from $x_i$ to $x_j$
