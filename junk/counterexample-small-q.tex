\subsection{Counterexamples to Theorem~\ref{thm:NN} when $q < 2$}
Consider three points $A, B, C$ with distances $AB = 1, BC=1,AC= 2^{1/q}$.
The $q$-edge power metric from $A$ to $C$ is clearly $2$, but the $q$-NN
cost from $A$ to $C$ is less than $2$: this can be seen since the Voronoi
cell containing $B$ crosses line $AC$, and thus the $q$-NN cost of going
from $A$ to $C$ in point set $\{A,B,C\}$ is strictly less than the $q$-NN
cost of going from $A$ to $C$ in pointset $\{A,C\}$, the latter of which is
$2$.
