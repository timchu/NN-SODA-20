 abstract = {Let P be a Poisson process of intensity one in a square $S_n$ of area n. We construct a random geometric graph $G_n,k$ by joining each point of P to its k $\equiv$ k(n) nearest neighbours. Recently, Xue and Kumar proved that if k $\leq$ 0.074 log n then the probability that $G_n,k$ is connected tends to 0 as n $\rightarrow \infty$ while, if k $\geq$ 5.1774 log n, then the probability that $G_n,k$ is connected tends to 1 as n $\rightarrow \infty$. They conjectured that the threshold for connectivity is k = (1 + o(1)) log n. In this paper we improve these lower and upper bounds to 0.3043 log n and 0.5139 log n, respectively, disproving this conjecture. We also establish lower and upper bounds of 0.7209 log n and 0.9967 log n for the directed version of this problem. A related question concerns coverage. With $G_n,k$ as above, we surround each vertex by the smallest (closed) disc containing its k nearest neighbours. We prove that if k $\leq$ 0.7209 log n then the probability that these discs cover $S_n$ tends to 0 as n $\rightarrow \infty$ while, if k $\geq$ 0.9967 log n, then the probability that the discs cover $S_n$ tends to 1 as n $\rightarrow \infty$.},

Known algorithms for finding the MST are discussed. They are efficient even when there are very many points; this makes a SLCA practicable when other methods of cluster analysis are not. The relevant computing procedures are published in the Algorithm section of the same issue of Applied Statistics. The use of the MST in the interpretation of vector diagrams arising in multivariate analysis is illustrated by an example.},

abstract="The K-Means clustering is by far the most widely used method for discovering clusters in data. It has a good performance on the data with compact super-sphere distributions, but tends to fail in the data organized in more complex and unknown shapes. In this paper, we analyze in detail the characteristic property of data clustering and propose a novel dissimilarity measure, named density-sensitive distance metric, which can describe the distribution characteristic of data clustering. By using this dissimilarity measure, a density-sensitive K-Means clustering algorithm is given, which has the ability to identify complex non-convex clusters compared with the original K-Means algorithm. The experimental results on both artificial data sets and real-world problems assess the validity of the algorithm.",
