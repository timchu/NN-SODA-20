\subsection{Construction of $\Conv$}
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:flow} There exists a function $\Conv$ such that for
any
path piece $\phi$ running from $x$ and $x+\Delta(x)$, $\len_{qN}(\phi) \geq
MCF_{G'}(B'(x+\Delta(x))-B'(x))$. Here, $MCF_{G'}(d)$ for $d \in
\mathbb{R}^{2^n}$ represents the minimum cost flow on $G'$ satisfying demands
$d$ on the vertices of $G'$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}

The distance from $v_0$ to $v_{\{0,n-1\}}$ on the graph is equal to
$u_{n-1}-u_0$ (NORMALIZE THINGS PROPERLY, INDEX THINGS PROPER, SET COMMON
VARIABLE NAMES), and the distance from $v_{\{0, n-1\}}$ to $v_{n-1}$ is the
same. Thus, this path from $v_0$ to $v_n$ equals $SP_G(x_0, x_n)$, as the
latter is trivially equal to $u_{n-1} - u_0$.

\end{proof}

Thus, it suffices to prove that

\[ SP_{G'}(v_0, v_n) \geq SP_G(x_0, x_n) \]
