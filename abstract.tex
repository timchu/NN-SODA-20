In the machine learning setting, distances between two datapoints in a Euclidean point set are considered short if they are in the same data cluster - even if their Euclidean distance is long. A simple metric with this property is the Nearest neighbor metric, defined by finding a shortest path on a manifold constructed from the point set. This metric and its close variants have been studied in the past by multiple researchers.

One key problem on manifold metrics, dating back for four centuries, is
computing them exactly. The Nearest Neighbor metric, like any
manifold-based metric, is the infimum cost path over an uncountable number
of paths that can go 'anywhere' on a continuous manifold. This makes
computing the Nearest Neighbor metric exactly challenging, even for a fixed
set of four points in two dimensions. In this paper, we overcome this
difficulty by equating the Nearest Neighbor metric to a shortest-path
distance on a simple geometric graph, in all cases. This result
considerably strengthens the work of Cohen et al. We then show how to
exactly compute a generalization of the Nearest Neighbor metric, called the
$q$-Nearest Neighbor metric, for small point sets.  Our tools include
conservative vector fields, Lipschitz extensions, minimum cost flows, and barycentric subdivisions, all applied to a geometric object we call the $q$-screw simplex.

The key geometric object in our proof, the $q$-screw simplex, was first discovered by John Von Neumann and Issai Schoenberg. This simplex is defined by taking $n$ points on a line, applying the $1/q$ power to all pairwise distances, and isometrically embedding the resulting point set into Euclidean space. In this paper, we prove that the $q$-screw simplex has a deep connection to fractional Laplacians, a differential operator that appears in a wide variety of physics and mathematical settings. We use this connection to prove that the $q$-screw simplex embeds isometrically into Effective resistance distance, and that its volume and circumcenter can be approximated efficiently using a Laplacian determinant estimator and Laplacian system solver respectively. We also show that any finite $l_1$ metric raised to the $1/q$ power is isometrically embeddable into $l_1$, mirroring a famous theorem by Schoenberg on $l_2$. 

Finally, we compute sparse spanners for the Nearest Neighbor metric and show links to existing problems ranging from persistent homology, geodesic approximation, density-based clustering, and Euclidean MST.
