  Let $P\subset \R^d$ be a set of $n$ points.
  Pick any \emph{source} point $s\in P$.
  Order the points of $P$ as $p_1,\ldots ,p_n$ so that
  \[
    \dist_2(s,p_1) \le \cdots \le \dist_2(s, p_n).
  \]
  This will imply that $p_1 = s$.
  It will suffice to show that for all $p_i\in P$, we have $\dist_2(s,p_i) = \dist_N(s,p_i)$.
  There are three main steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We first show that when $P$ is a subset of the vertices of an axis-aligned box, $\dist = \dist_N$.  In this case, shortest paths for $\dist$ are single edges and shortest paths for $\dist_N$ are straight lines.
    \item We then show how to lift the points from $\R^d$ to $\R^n$ by a Lipschitz map $m$ that places all the points on the vertices of a box and preserves $\dist_2(s,p)$ for all $p\in P$.
    \item Finally, we show how the Lipschitz extension of $m$ is also Lipschitz as a function between Nearest Neighbor Metric distances.  We combine these pieces to show that $\dist \le \dist_N$.  As $\dist \ge \dist_N$ (Lemma~\ref{lem:dist_N_le_dist}), this will conclude the proof that $\dist = \dist_N$.
  \end{enumerate}
We note that each of these steps still holds when our point set is the
collection of $n$ disjoint, path-connected compact sets in countable
dimension space. In general, path-connected compact sets in countable
dimensoin can have extremely convoluted geometry, and the Voronoi diagrams
on these collections can be massively complex: making exact computation of the
Nearest Neighbor metric on this collection of sets seemingly intractable.
However, the Kirszbraun theorem remarkably still applies
in this setting, and our Lipschitz map will squash each compact object down
to a single point. In this way, our Lipschitz map is robust enough to
handle objects of considerable geometric complexity.
