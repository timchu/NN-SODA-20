\subsubsection{Generating a Lipschitz embedding into \R^n} % (fold)
\label{sec:lifting}
  
We seek to find points $m(p_i) \in \R^n$ such that 
\begin{align}\label{eq:preserve}
\dist_q(m(s,p_i),m(s,p_{i-1})) = \dist_q(s, p_i) - \dist_q(s,p_{i-1} )$
\end{align}

To find $m$, we perform a breadth-first search to find points on the real
line $x_0 < x_1 < \ldots x_{n-1}$ such that $x_i-x_{i-1} = \dist_q(s, p_i
- dist_q(s, p_{i-1})$. These points $x_i$ can be found with a simple
  breadth first search on our points. Note that if we set $m(p_0), \ldots
m(p_{n-1})$ as the vertices of the $q$-screw simplex
formed from points $x_0, x_1, \ldots x_n$, then Equation~\ref{eq:preserve}
holds.
