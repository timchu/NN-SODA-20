\section{Outline}
%   Definitions of the nearest-neighbor geodesic distance, and of the
%     edge-squared metric, are provided in
%    Section~\ref{sec:definitions}.
%  
Section~\ref{sec:NN} contains the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:NN},
equating the edge-squared metric and nearest-neighbor geodesic distance in
all cases. We then
compute the persistent homology of the nearest-neighbor
geodesic distance.
Section~\ref{sec:general-spanner} outlines a proof of
Theorem~\ref{thm:general-spanner}, and compares our
spanner to new lower bounds
on the sparsity of $(1+\eps)$-spanners of the Euclidean metric.
We outline a proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:distribution-spanner} in
Section~\ref{sec:distribution-spanner} and discuss its implications.  

Section~\ref{sec:edge-power} introduces the $p$-power metrics. We show
that Euclidean spanners and Euclidean MSTs are special cases of
$p$-power spanners. We show how
clustering algorithms including $k$-means, level-set methods,
and single linkage clustering, are special cases of
clustering with $p$-power metrics.


Conclusions and open questions are in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}. Full proofs for
Theorems~\ref{thm:distribution-spanner},~\ref{thm:general-spanner}
are contained in the Appendix.
