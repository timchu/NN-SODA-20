\subsection{Reduction to $q$-screw simplex} % (fold)
\label{sec:reduction-to-screw}
In this section, we prove that it suffices to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:NN}
and~\ref{thm:qNN} on the $q$-screw simplex. We do so by doing it when
$q=2$, and noting that the proof generalizes naturally for any $q > 2$.

  Let $P\subset \R^d$ be a set of $n$ points.
  Pick any \emph{source} point $s\in P$.
  Order the points of $P$ as $p_1,\ldots ,p_n$ so that
  \[
    \dist_2(s,p_1) \le \cdots \le \dist_2(s, p_n).
  \]
  This will imply that $p_1 = s$.
  It will suffice to show that for all $p_i\in P$, we have $\dist_2(s,p_i) = \dist_N(s,p_i)$.
  There are three main steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We first show that when $P$ is a subset of the vertices of an axis-aligned box, $\dist = \dist_N$.  In this case, shortest paths for $\dist$ are single edges and shortest paths for $\dist_N$ are straight lines.
		\item We then show how to lift the points from $\R^d$ to $\R^n$ by a
Lipschitz map $m$ that places all the points on the vertices of a $q$-screw
simplex, and preserves preserves $\dist_2(s,p)$ for all $p\in P$.
		\item Finally, we show how the Lipschitz extension of $m$ is also
Lipschitz as a function between nearest neighbor geodesics.  We combine
these pieces to show that $\dist \le \dist_N$.  As $\dist \ge \dist_N$
(Lemma~\ref{lem:dist_N_le_dist}), this will conclude the proof that $\dist
= \dist_N$.
