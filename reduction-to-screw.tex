\subsection{Reduction to $q$-screw simplex} % (fold)
\label{sec:reduction-to-screw}
In this section, we prove that it suffices to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:NN}
and~\ref{thm:qNN} on the $q$-screw simplex. We do so by doing it when
$q=2$, and noting that the proof generalizes naturally for any $q > 2$.

  Let $P\subset \R^d$ be a set of $n$ points.
  Pick any \emph{source} point $s\in P$.
  Order the points of $P$ as $p_1,\ldots ,p_n$ so that
  \[
    \dist_q(s,p_1) \le \cdots \le \dist_q(s, p_n).
  \]
  This will imply that $p_1 = s$.
  It will suffice to show that for all $p_i\in P$, we have $\dist_q(s,p_i)
= \dist_{qN}(s,p_i)$.
The core step is that we will find a Lipschitz map $m: \R \rightarrow \R^n$
that preserves $\dist_q(s,p)$ for all $p \in P$. We will then show how the
Lipschitz extension of $m$ is also Lipschitz as a function between $q$-NN
metrics. If we can do this, then the $q$-NN cost of any path from $s$ to
$p_i$ on our initial point set is lower bounded by the $q$-NN cost of the
image of the path under $m$, from $m(s)$ to $m(p_i)$ (since the map is Lipschitz as a function
between $q$-NN metrics). If the Theorem holds on $m(p_1), m(p_2), \ldots
m(p_{n-1})$, then this $q$-NN cost is lower bounded by the shortest path
from $p_0$ to $p_{n-1}$, as desired.
