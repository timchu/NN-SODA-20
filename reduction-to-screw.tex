\subsection{Reduction to $q$-screw simplex} % (fold)
\label{sec:reduction-to-screw}
In this section, we prove that it suffices to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:NN}
and~\ref{thm:qNN} on the $q$-screw simplex. We do so by doing it when
$q=2$, and noting that the proof generalizes naturally for any $q > 2$.

  Let $P\subset \R^d$ be a set of $n$ points.
  Pick any \emph{source} point $s\in P$.
  Order the points of $P$ as $p_1,\ldots ,p_n$ so that
  \[
    \dist_q(s,p_1) \le \cdots \le \dist_q(s, p_n).
  \]
  This will imply that $p_1 = s$.
  It will suffice to show that for all $p_i\in P$, we have $\dist_2(s,p_i) = \dist_N(s,p_i)$.
  There are three main steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item We first show that the theorem holds for $2$-screw simplices, and
for $q$-screw simplices when $q > 2$.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We will construct a graph $G'$ on the points $x_0, x_1, \ldots x_n$
of the $q$-screw simplex, and prove that the $q$-NN distance between $p_1$
and $p_n$ is bounded above by the shortest path distance between
corresponding vertices on $G'$.
	\item We show that the shortest path on $G'$ and the shortest path
on $G$ coincide when $q=2$, and for $4$ point sets when $q>2$.  
\end{enumerate}
  \item We then show how to lift the points from $\R^d$ to $\R^n$ by a
Lipschitz map $m$ that places all the points on the vertices of a $q$-screw
simplex, and preserves $\dist_q(s,p)$ for all $p\in
P$\tim{define $\dist_q$}
  \item We show how the Lipschitz extension of $m$ is also
Lipschitz as a function between $q$-power Nearest Neighbor metrics. 
We combine these pieces to show that $\dist_2 \le \dist_N$.  As $\dist_2
\ge \dist_N$ (Lemma~\ref{lem:dist_N_le_dist}), this will conclude the proof
that $\dist_2 = \dist_N$. The analagous result holds for $4$ point sets in
the $q$-NN metric, which concludes the proof that $\dist_q = \dist_{qN}$
for all $q>2$ for $4$ point sets.
  \end{enumerate}
