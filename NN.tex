\section{Exactly Computing the Nearest Neighbor Metric}
\label{sec:NN}
In this section, we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:NN}. By
Lemma~\ref{lem:dist_N_le_dist}, it suffices to show that for $a$ and $b$
on Euclidean point set $P$, we have $\dist_N(a, b) \geq \dist_2(a,b)$ for $a, b
\in P$. This allows us exact computation of the Nearest Neighbor Metric.
